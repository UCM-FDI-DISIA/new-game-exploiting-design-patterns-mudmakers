# MUDMakers

![](misc/ppt_img.jpeg)

MUDMakers is a refactored game with a medieval theme based on the Java game WastelandMUD. The game has a basic GUI with one window which we hope to improve in the near future. At the moment we modified the game by adding new objects and mobs, both enemies and pets. 

MUDMakers consists on traveling through the different rooms in a map collecting useful items in order to fight enemies and defeat the final boss.
