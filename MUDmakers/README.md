# WasteLandMUD
Source code for WasteLandMUDRefactored

This code is an ongoing initiative to use an existing Java code project 
(the WastelandMUD game by Matt Turner, Ross Bottorf, Zach Boe and Jonathan Perrine) as 
an example for my students of Software Engineering of how 
the design patterns from the book by Erich Gamma et al can be applied in practice 
to provide flexibility, reusability and modular design. 

No implication should be read into the effort that this refactoring is in any way better than the original. 

The whole effort occurs under conflicting constraints of:

(1) making the design comply with the theoretical descriptions in the book, 
(2) remaining as close as possible to the original code, 
(3) providing working ground for group discussions on design issues. 

For these reasons, the coding solutions in operation are often far from ideal.
