 * The StrengthPotion class can be used to create objects a player can consume to

 * strength potion will increase the player's strength points by the amount of strength
 * points it has available and set itself to zero strength points. A thread in the
 * strength potion runs every 30 seconds to regenerate the StrengthPotion's strength points
 * by one increment until it reaches its max strength points. It extends Gear and
 * Implements Runnable.
